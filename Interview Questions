## Wireshark Q&A

### 1. What is Wireshark used for?
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect network packets in real time for troubleshooting and learning how communication works on a network.

### 2. What is a packet?
A packet is a small unit of data transmitted over a network, containing header information (source, destination, protocol) and payload (actual data).

### 3. How to filter packets in Wireshark?
Packet filtering is done using the Filter Bar. Examples:
tcp
udp
dns
ip.addr == 192.168.1.10

### 4. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
| TCP | UDP |
|-----|-----|
| Connection-oriented | Connection-less |
| Reliable and ensures delivery | Faster but delivery not guaranteed |
| Retransmits lost packets | No retransmission |
| Used for browsing, email | Used for gaming, calling, streaming |

### 5. What is a DNS query packet?
A DNS query packet is a request sent to a DNS server asking for the IP address of a domain name.

### 6. How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?
Packet capture shows real traffic between devices and servers, helping identify delays, failures, misconfigurations, and suspicious activity.

### 7. What is a protocol?
A protocol is a set of rules that defines how devices communicate over a network (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS).

### 8. Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?
Yes, but only if encryption keys are available (e.g., SSL/TLS keys). Without keys, encrypted traffic like HTTPS cannot be decrypted.
